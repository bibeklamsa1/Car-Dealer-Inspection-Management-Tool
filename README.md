# Car Dealer Management
<br>
As a part-time salesman at a used car dealership, I identified significant challenges in managing vehicles from private sellers. Tracking cars, organizing MR Numbers, 
and ensuring timely inspections were inefficient due to the high volume of incoming vehicles. Many cars missed their inspection deadlines,
requiring a repeat vehicle inspection, which incurred additional costs of approximately $200 per car.

To address this issue, I developed Car Dealer Management, an application designed to streamline the tracking of each vehicle, manage MR Numbers efficiently,
and provide timely notifications regarding upcoming inspection deadlines. By ensuring inspections are completed within the given timeframe,
this app helps dealerships avoid unnecessary expenses and improve overall operational efficiency.
